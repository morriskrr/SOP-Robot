# HAND CLIENT

## How to run

Ensure that you have set up the robot as instructed in [Robot bring-up](../docs/BRINGUP.md) and that r_hand_controller is up and running. If not, refer back to the [bring-up](../docs/BRINGUP.md).

Once the robot is running properly, open a new command window, and start the client with the following command.

```
python3 client/hand_action_client.py 
```

## How to use

Once the client is up and running you will be greeted by a command line interface asking for your next command.

```
Input command:
```

Type in the command you want and watch as the hand completes the action.

## The commands

Currently, the following actions are available.

| Action    | What it does                              |
| --------  | ----------------------------------------- | 
| open      | Extends all fingers                       | 
| fist      | Forms a fist                              | 
| scissors  | Extends index and middle finger           | 
| point     | Extends index finger                      | 
| thumbs_up | Gives a thumbs up!                        | 
| grasp     | Grasps an object                          | 
| hard_rock | Heavy metal                               | 
| pen_grasp | Grasps with index and middle finger       | 
| rps       | Plays a round of Rock-Paper_scissors      | 
| trial     | Allows you to put in your custom position | 

### Trial

As told above the trial command allows you to set a custom position for the fingers. This is done by asking a position for each finger separately. Each finger must be given a position as ROS2 does not allow the hand to move without specifying positions for all the joints in the r_hand_controller. 

## IMPORTANT THE CUSTOM STATES MUST BE BETWEEN -0.5 AND 2 YOU WILL BREAK THE HAND IF YOU GO BEYOND THESE
